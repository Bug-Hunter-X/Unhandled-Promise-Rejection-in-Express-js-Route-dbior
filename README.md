# Unhandled Promise Rejection in Express.js Route

This repository demonstrates a common error in Node.js applications: unhandled promise rejections.  The `bug.js` file shows an Express.js route with an asynchronous operation that may fail.  Crucially, it lacks proper error handling, leading to a silent failure or, in some environments, a crash. The `bugSolution.js` file provides the corrected code.

## How to Reproduce

1. Clone this repository.
2. Navigate to the repository's directory.
3. Run `node bug.js`.  The server will start, but if the asynchronous operation fails (approximately 50% chance), there will be no clear indication of the error.
4. Run `node bugSolution.js` to see the corrected version with proper error handling.

## Importance of Error Handling

Unhandled promise rejections are problematic because they can make debugging difficult.  Comprehensive error handling is essential for robust applications.  Always handle potential errors in asynchronous operations using `.catch()` or `try...catch` blocks.
